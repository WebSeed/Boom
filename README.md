Port of an old Nokia WidSets game to use HTML5 canvas and [grobo.js](http://www.github.com/WebSeed/grobo.js)

## History

In 2007 I created a platform game for Nokia's now defunct [WidSets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WidSets) platform. All the code was written in "Helium script" (a proprietary Java-light style scripting language).

The original code is only around 2000 lines with a lot of fixed-point number going on (thought I'd lost this to be honest but thankfully found it attached to an email in an old Hotmail account!).

Thought this would be a good opportunity to try this out together with the [grobo.js](http://www.github.com/WebSeed/grobo.js) framework I cobbled together.
